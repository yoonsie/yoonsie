          <p class="blog-h2">Process</p>
          <p class="blog">After taking a box-making class in Reston and a cutting board class in Arlington, I decided it was time to take on my first independent* woodworking project. I wanted a solid wood bookcase that would be custom-made to reach the same height of my desk. I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjQvG2o6kCA" target="_blank">YouTube video <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> for the design and most of the instructions, and got help from the supervisor for Independent Study woodshop at the community center, Art, to finally complete my bookcase. I'm very proud of it, and also very grateful to Art, as this was an extremely ambitious first project. I'm almost glad that I was ignorant of how difficult it was, since I'd probably have felt too overwhelmed to start.</p>
          <p class="blog">I still haven't "finished" it, as in, I haven't added "finishing" to it. The plan is to use denatured alcohol and shellac, but we'll see. I'm in no rush. Its main function has been fulfilled, and it's as useful as is it is gorgeous.</p>
