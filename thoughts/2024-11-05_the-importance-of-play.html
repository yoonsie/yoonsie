          <p>
            Modern society embraces a tacit notion that I materially disagree with: that play is for children. This convention manifests in societal expectations for how adults should work, talk, and even spend their leisure time.  And concerningly, it robs adults from learning more effectively, working more efficiently, bonding with others more closely, and—most importantly—living life more joyfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            The origin of play served a crucial purpose: to help a species learn<sup><a href="https://cdn2.psychologytoday.com/assets/what_is_play_published.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. Play allows us to engage, and thereby, learn more quickly and thoroughly. And yet, anyone employed can attest that it is woefully lacking in the workplace. Employee training/learning is particularly important in the early months at a new position or company; and yet, onboarding is typically unengaging and unstructured for most. Even on the job, rare is it to find people who sincerely love their job. Despite several published studies on how play benefits employee satisfaction and retention, much of how we work remains largely unchanged since the industrial revolution.
          </p>

            At a group level, play fosters trust and safety—the critical ingredients for psychological safety which allows employees to experiment, take risks, make mistakes, learn from them, and then improve their processes and/or products. Trust serves as a a connective tissue allowing for more efficient knowledge sharing and collaboration. Even as well-researched as the benefits of play on innovation are<sup><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5492787?casa_token=OenJoI4lzCkAAAAA:SaSaFroFQV8duSDdpAYjmBKjexS8YIa2Mg_31n9BADx050iwjM3D5oBSplSEiatMVwVUeW0eLpKmKQ" target="_blank">2</a></sup> (a.k.a. a company’s bottom dollar), little is done to prioritize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond work, play (with others) improves social and emotional intelligence<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-018-2506-6#Sec6" target="_blank">3</a></sup>, as it allows us to more easily form connections and interact with others in an engaging and safe setting. Additionally, playing collaboratively towards a common goal improves bonds we have with each other. But for many adults, the idea of finding friends or romantic partners looks sedentary and involves substances—lacking the playfulness factor that would aid in forming deeper connections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Play, by definition, is an activity that is enjoyed outside the bounds of time, allowing us to enter a flow state<sup><a href=”https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15” target=”_blank”>4</a></sup>. This flow state allows us to live more presently and, as argued by Csikszentmihalyi, more happily. If play were prioritized at a societal level for all age groups, what might that world look like? Maybe a world where all ages can experiment with different hobbies and careers, where the default is a growth mindset over a fixed mindset<sup><a href=”https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fT6U0Ee7_kQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=mindset+carol+dweck&ots=kJyHzv8WRj&sig=QW8T-vkXokVrN7E1awesiZEa0UY#v=snippet&q=scarcity&f=false” target=”_blank”>5</a></sup> and abundance over scarcity, and where learning is playing and playing is living<sup><a href="https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1080/00094056.1962.10726996” target="_blank”>6</a></sup>.
