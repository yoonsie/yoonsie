          At first glance, you (hopefully) see something that resembles an apple in the above image. It shares a simplified version of its characteristics in both shape and color. You may even be familiar with this type of art known as pixel art. Upon closer inspection, you might see highlights and shadows in the form of a cartoonishly white shine and darker shades of red and green. If you are familiar with pixel art styles, you may also have noticed that I opted for sharp black outlines rather than the less harsh style of using darker hues of an existing color palette.

          The more you learn about a subject—in this case, pixel art—the more details you can perceive in it. Conversely, more time/attention spent perceiving something allows you to learn more about it<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0,11&q=Pick,+Herbert+L.+"Eleanor+J.+Gibson:+Learning+to+perceive+and+perceiving+to+learn."+Developmental+Psychology+28.5+(1992):+787.&btnG=" target="_blank">1</a></sup>.

          It took me decades to finally grasp that much of learning a new skill relies on the skill of perceiving. Drawing has less to do with the ability to “draw”, but more to do with the ability to “see” or perceive. It’s like Yogi Berra said, "Baseball is 90% mental and 10% physical".  Most people have the physical capability of drawing the Mona Lisa. The difficulty in drawing is not the physical exertion but the mental perception of patterns that allow you to distill your vision onto the canvas: hues, values, shapes, textures, space, etc.

          This model of learning applies to all new skills, even those that don’t necessarily involve visual perception. Whether you’re learning to play an instrument, write standup jokes, or do a headstand, all skills are acquired through perception. Shortcuts can be identified by finding patterns of perception. And the faster one can learn to recognize patterns in a subject, whether from a teacher, a book, or personal experience, the faster one can learn to perceive, and therefore, the faster one can learn.
