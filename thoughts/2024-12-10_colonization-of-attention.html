        <p class="blog">
          I recently watched a clip of <a href="https://youtu.be/SUTbnjIHfkg?si=sOlQTxCCmcmj7rX8&t=76" target="_blank">Bo Burnham's comments <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-2xs" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> about social media, which can be applied to the attention economy at large.
          <blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/SUTbnjIHfkg?si=sOlQTxCCmcmj7rX8&t=76">Because these companies went public they have to grow, they cannot stay stagnant. It is unprofitable. We colonized the entire Earth. There was no other place for business and capitalism to expand into, and then they realized [they can colonize] human attention. They are now trying to colonize every minute of your life. Every single free moment you have is a moment you could be looking at your phone and they could be gathering information to target ads at you. </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p class="blog">
          Burnham provides an interesting perspective. We are bombarded by companies that compete for our attention to either (a) sell us stuff or (b) sell our data to a company that can sell us stuff. Per Burnham, businesses have gone to colonize resources in this sequence:
        </p>
          <ul class="blog">
            <li>Land</li>
            <li>Attention</li>
          </ul>
        <p>But, I'd like to reword what was and what will be colonized:
        </p>
        <ul class="blog">
          <li>Environmental Resources: Water, Land, Seeds/Spices, Animals, etc.</li>
          <li>Human Resources: Labor/Time, <span class="strong">Attention</span>, and <span class="strong">Intelligence</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          People have already extended beyond colonizing environmental resources to human resources centuries ago. Today though, they are expanding upon colonizing just our labor and time to our attention, as Burnham said, and with the advent of ubiquitous AI, our intelligence. AI is not created from thin air. Artificial Intelligence is an artifice, defined as a "clever trick/stratagem", sourced from and simulating of human intelligence. AI programs are trained on data created by humans. Much of the collective knowledge humans have documented and shared is being fed to AI programs without prior communication let alone consent. Companies exploit the collective labor and contributions of others for profit. Most insiduously, they frequently sell products that harm the same individuals that made it possible for them to capitalize on their very own labor. Though AI technology is new, its model of exploitation is not. A similarly hard-to-resist and high-demand commodity which followed this model was sugar. Enslaved people were forced to cultivate sugar, which was then sold back to their communities, creating a cycle of economic exploitation<sup><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/sugar-slave-trade-slavery.html" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. As a result of both oppression and resourcefulness, sugar became a cornerstone of their diet, which has led to modern repercussions among these very communities: The likelihood of diet-impacted diseases such as diabetes is much higher among the affected diaspora<sup><a href="https://thedo.osteopathic.org/columns/food-from-the-soul-a-history-of-african-american-culture-and-nutrition/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p>While AI does not fall under the category of slavery, it shares elements of powerlessness and a lack of consent. In both cases, the product is extracted from individuals—whether through labor or data—and re-commodified back to those very individuals who contributed to its creation. This process is evident in how AI systems rely on data generated by users, yet these users often receive no direct compensation for their contributions. It is also pervasive in the growing concerns of the overreliance of AI tools. If AI is our sugar, what will be our diabetes?</p>
