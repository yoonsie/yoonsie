          The three pillars of foundational health are sleep, sustenance, and sport. The bidirectional influences between sleep and diet<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322007803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a></sup>, sleep and exercise<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1559827614544437" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a></sup>, or diet and exercise<sup><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/3016426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a></sup> are well-researched topics that don't need to be exhausted further. But these three elements, which create a virtuous cycle of health, can easily be corrupted into a vicious cycle of its dearth. I’m currently in a situation where I am in a vicious cycle and trying to crawl out of it back into a virtuous one. I’m writing this post in an attempt to expedite this process for myself.

          Good quality sleep seems to have become elusive—whether it’s the poverty of resources that can turn sleep into a privilege, the prolific distractions on screens that decrease sleep quality<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9638701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5</a></sup>, or the prevalence of lifestyles that no longer rely on the circadian triggers that our bodies evolved to rely on (e.g. going outside, getting sun). So, how do we get good sleep and how do we get more of it? The answer is likely unique to each individual, but the general guideline is to establish rituals and systems that make it easier to fall asleep, or harder to participate in activities preventing sleep. My personal perspective shift which helps me is to focus on going to sleep earlier, rather than focusing on waking up earlier. I already have a bedtime ritual to always brush, floss, and shower before bed, so I initiate this ritual by setting an alarm on my phone labeled “brush teeth”. Other tips:
          <ul class="blog">
            <li>65-68 F is the recommended temperature to sleep</li>
            <li>No screens 1-2 hours before bedtime</li>
            <li>No food 3 hours before bedtime</li>
            <li>Waking up to light is more pleasant than a jarring alarm sound. I’m paranoid about missing my alarm, so I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TB6VXFL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheap smart bulb<i class="fa fa-external-link fa-2xs" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> that I schedule to fade on for 45 minutes about ~15 minutes before my sound alarm. My sound alarm is a peaceful one that uses a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2kFMEs9M3Uc1NmMvFXeLzi?si=TYX2ykkuSf-26Q8VjnWuIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kalimba playlist<i class="fa fa-external-link fa-2xs" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>

          In a highly consumerist and capitalist society, profit margins are prioritized above all else. Companies repeat the recipe that causes people to consume more—by providing modern-day conveniences that exploit our evolutionary tendencies to exert minimal energy<sup><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/3016426" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a></sup>. It’s come to the extent that people have a near-insatiable desire for stimulation, self-dosing in the form of excess food or entertainment. I personally believe that the obesity epidemic is more heavily a systemic policy-related problem than an individual one. However, I don’t see any regulations of food, food labeling, or food marketing changing anytime soon, so in the meantime, here are some tips:
          <ul class="blog">
            <li>Try to eat meals at the same time every day</li>
            <li>Try to “automate” your breakfast (if you eat it) and lunch; use a regular rotation of the same meals. You can change them out seasonally, but limit the choices so you don’t exhaust your brainpower trying to feed yourself. Exhaustion leads to desiring convenience → unhealthy eating habits.</li>
            <li>If you’re an emotional eater like me, practice mindfulness (and go to therapy if you can) to work on the root issues which cause disordered eating (in my case, binge eating)</li>
          </ul>

          I chose this alliteration of 3 S’s instead of 3 F’s (food, fitness, and a full night’s sleep) since I prefer the word “sport” over the typical American English terms “exercise”, “fitness”, and especially “workout”.  I got the idea from an unexpected translation I heard from a native French speaker while at a language exchange meetup in Paris. They asked me if I “do sport”—a direct translation of “faire du sport” which is a way to say “to exercise” in French. I relished this translation quirk, since “sport” sounds much more exciting and <a href="2024-11-05_the-importance-of-play.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fun</a> than the usual options, and have used this alliteration since.

          Categorizing exercise as a discrete activity is a big part of why it’s so hard to incorporate it. Inspired by my friend’s description of the modern lifestyle, I call it the “box phenomenon.” The typical American will ride in a box (car) to go to another box (office building) and sit in a box (cubicle or office room). After work, they will then go back into their box (car) to go to yet another box (gym building), only to ride their traveling box (car) back into their domestic box (apartment, house).

          Viewing exercise as a foreign entity transforms it into something easier to dread. With this perspective, there’s an assumption that it is a chore or “todo item”, and it’s prevalent in the language we use to describe it (working out, exercising) and the way we schedule it into our lives. This default definition of fitness is known as intentional exercise, and some scholars argue for the importance of its complement: incidental exercise<sup><a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/health-fitness/fitness/podcast-955-the-power-of-neat-move-a-little-to-lose-a-lot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7</a></sup>. While a 30-minute block of daily intentional exercise is beneficial, remaining sedentary for our remaining waking hours is still detrimental to our health; instead, we can try to incorporate NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis)<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3782097/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8</a></sup>. Neat is defined as the energy expended for everything we do that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise—movements we don’t think of as exercise which very much serve the same function: pacing, fidgeting, doing laundry, washing dishes, etc.

        <p class="blog">
          For fitness, a shift in mindset is crucial to sustaining long-term habits, as it lacks the immediate survival necessity of eating or sleeping. Unlike the other two, exercise is not essential for day-to-day existence, though it is essential for overall health and longevity. Some tips for incorporating both intentional and incidental movement:
          <ul class="blog">
            <li>View all physical activities as exercise (remember NEAT). Feeling like you’re already ahead will encourage you to do more, not less</li>
            <li>If you drive, park your car as far from the entrance as possible</li>
            <li>If you have the option to walk, bike, or use public transportation versus driving, take it</li>
            <li>Start a physically active hobby that you enjoy (dancing, photography, hiking, etc.)</li>
            <li>Be flexible, not rigid; especially, if you live somewhere with seasons, expect your physical activities to change</li>
            <li>Find a friend to "do sport" with😄</li>
          </ul>
