          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasize">Capacity-based</span>: I don't have the time/skills/resources/conditions to...

          <li>
            <span class="emphasize">Merit-based</span>: I don't deserve to X, until Y [happens]
            <ul>
              <li>ask for help at work; I prove my worth</li>
              <li>love my body; I lose weight</li>
              <li>be happy; I get a degree/job/house</li>

          <li>
            <span class="emphasize">Outcome-based</span>: If X, then that means Y
            <ul>
              <li>my project isn't perfect; I'm incompetent</li>

        <ul class="blog">
          <li>
            <span class="emphasize">Why Can't I? Framework</span>: Keep asking yourself "Why" until you understand why you think you can't accomplish something. Try to objectively examine and reassess if this core belief is still or ever was valid.
            <ul>
              <li>Example original self-limiting belief: "I can't draw"</li>
              <li>Why can't I?: I've always been bad</li>
              <li>Why?: I have poor hand-eye coordination</li>
              <li>Is this a valid claim (has this always been true in all contexts? Will it always definitively be the case considering the brain is plastic?): No, I can practice and improve my hand-eye coordination</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="emphasize">Identify Thinking Traps</span>: Review and examine if your belief falls into any of these common thinking traps
            <ul>
              <li>All-or-nothing/perfectionistic thinking: If I don't do this perfectly, I've failed; I can't do X, until Y, Z conditions are met.</li>
              <li>Catastrophizing: If I fail at this, everyone will think I'm incompetent.</li>
              <li>Over-generalizing: If I fail at this, that means I am a failure and will fail at Y and Z.</li>
              <li>Mind-reading: People will think I'm annoying or too ambitious if I try to get promoted.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>To Be Continued</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- <ul> -->
          <!-- <li>Definition: What is it. A combination of conditioning, holding onto outdated or sometimes wrong beliefs perspectives (learned helplessness in case of perspectives).</li>
          <li>Antidote: What's the antidote to these self-limitations? Feedback loop using mindfulness / self-awraeness. Practicing separation of thoughts/feelings from the self. Iteratively changing your beliefs and approaches based on new internal and external information (if you don't have enough info, seeking more information).  seeing if these beliefs you've identified are serving you/others and if you should still hold onto them. Also mindset change: internal vs external locus of control. People are happier when they feel they have control</li>
          <li>Examples</li>

          <li>Example: I can't do X until I have Y perfect conditions / perfectionism, sometimes consumerism/marketing/capitalism convincing you. I can't host a themed party unless I own a house. Wrong: Public parks, community centers for rental, etc</li>
          <li>Past example: I can't do woodworking because the other students are all boys and I bet they all have more experience than me</li>
          <li>Past example: I can't study computer science because boys are naturally better at this stuff [wrong]</li>
          <li>Science example: Female chess players perform worse</li>
          <li>Science example: Racial + gender bias in testing. Tell them bias ahead of time, they perform worse. Girls + math. POC + standardized testing, etc etc</li>
          <li>There's a reason why people say assume the confidence of an average white man. Richard Dyer on "White"</li>
          <li>Example: I can't learn Jazz Piano because it's too hard and I don't have enough time</li>
          <li>Example: I can't be loved until I accomplish X, Y, Z. (due to how I was raised)</li>
          <li>Example: I can't travel unless I have a partner (ex's younger cousin. Makes no sense)</li>
          <li>Example: I can't travel there because I have no one to go with [wrong]. Excluding safety</li>
