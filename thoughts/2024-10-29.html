          <p>If your mind is anything like mine, your stream of consciousness might resemble a squirrel jumping between trees more than a stream. Writing has shown, study<sup><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87567555.2012.697081" target="_blank">1</a></sup> after study<sup><a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=41MSDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA263&dq=expressive+writing&ots=M_ulzszwEk&sig=hirikuIf-SRKj1jQtv0fUv_PmLQ#v=onepage&q=expressive%20writing&f=false" target="_blank">2</a></sup>, that its functions extend beyond simple communication or documentation. Sitting down with one's thoughts, translating them into words, then organizing them into a coherent structure benefits the author's mind and, when writing for an audience, even a sense of belonging.</p>
          <p>Writing provides benefits to one's memory and even mental health. As it requires more engagement, writing strengthens your memory and understanding of a subject. In fact, expressive writing is used as a therapeutic tool to help process trauma, helping patients process and organize their past experiences. While writing for oneself for the purposes of journaling or therapy comes with its own benefits, writing for others enhances them. Keeping an audience in mind improves writing quality and clarity (think of how awkward it is to record a talk in front of a camera versus a person). Also, published writing leaves a paper trail of your progress, which helps foster a growth mindset by making it very obvious (and easy) to revisit your growth in your writing ability and the subject of your posts. In this way, both the act of writing in the present and the knowledge of having written in the past provide benefits to the writer that cannot be experienced from mere internal thoughts.</p>
          <p>Writing with the intent to inform or entertain others is a communal practice that has existed since the medium's invention. As a communication tool, it is inherently a communal tool, and therefore, participating in this practice will always instill some sense of community. Since writing for others is a form of sharing with others, practicing it will only improve your sense of belonging, even if the audience is only imaginary. [self-own]</p>
