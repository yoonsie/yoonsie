# hello world
hi i'm yoonsie and i've been online since i was 7 and haven't left since. welcome to my small space in the world wide web.

## work
i work as a senior consultant providing technical solutions for clients (mostly appian and sql). making people's lives easier is something i love doing. if you want to learn more, connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoonsiekim)!

## personal
i read way too many self-help books and like to use what i learn from work and books in my personal life. for example, i used the scrum framework to facilitate my move to arlington, va (retro item: next time i'll be sure there's more pizza).

## play
i'm in the process of learning line svg animation. i'm hoping to add some to my website soon!
