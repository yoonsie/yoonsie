                      <h3>About</h3>
                      <p>With everything I do, I am driven entirely by the perspective of the user or customer and have always worked hard to address pain points and provide value. Whether it's a user of a mobile app, a client invested in digital transformation, the students of my Japanese class, or the listeners of my podcast.</p>

                      <p>I have worked in customer service since I was 7 years old, when I traveled weekly with my mom to sell at local <a class="masthead-heading" href="https://www.cowtownfarmersmarket.com/" target="_blank">flea</a> <a href="https://www.columbusfarmersmarket.com/" target="_blank">markets</a>, including butterfly clips, watches, hats, and more.</p>

                      <p>I went with my mom to these markets until I was about 12 years old. But since then I have worked in a dry cleaners, a restaurant, a Dollar Tree (love Dollar Tree) - all before starting my higher education.</p>

                      <p>At university, and after taking leave for medical reasons, I of course learned of the privilege that my education granted me. At school, I was able to get cushy office jobs through the Federal Work Study program. During my medical leave, however, I struggled to even land a minimum-wage earning job. Eventually I was able to find work, but during this time I learned a lot and was truly confronted with the privilege that education, and a culture that encourages it, provided me. I am very lucky and thankful.</p>

                      <p>Eventually, I was able to get insurance (thanks Obama) and managed my return to college. During my 2.5 years out of school, I was able to introspect carefully what career path I wanted to pursue, and what I could study to get there. So I took the shift to study computer science and digital media, and worked my ass off to learn as much as I could and met some great people along the way.</p>

                      <p>My hard work paid off when I landed my first salaried job at a software consulting firm. During my tenure as a product consultant, I learned technical, business analytical, and product management skills. But most importantly, I was able to make use of the well-exercised empathy muscle I've trained since I was a kid, and I helped deliver the best technical solutions for customers.</p>
